# hello-world
A repo for practicing the GitHub flow

Hi! My name is Kyle Marcano (he/him).

I'm an Innovation Scientist at Atomo Coffee in Seattle, WA. 

I typically just work on the chemistry side of things in our food lab (with a dash of engineering here and there). 

But now I'm venturing into programming! 

Nice to meet you all!
